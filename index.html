    <p>This toy takes input, attempts to validate it, and gives an answer based on a hash of the value received. As for the type of validation this program attempts, it searches through a list of english words that questions typically start with, and if the input doesn't start with one of those words, it rejects it with a message instead of an answer. It also checks to make sure that the input ends in a question mark (?).
